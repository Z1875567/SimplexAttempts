Hello There!

This is a documentation file for getting the simplex package on python to work. I'll occasionally post updates in here to update progress and implementation procedures.

09_20_21 - 
I'm currently trying to find the library that the Simplex method is implemented in, otherwise, I'll try to implement it myself. If I have time today, I'll find it and post it under today's date. Otherwise, I'll have to find it another day.
